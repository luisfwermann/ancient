This project was created as a response of a challenge for an interview process I got involved.

The goal was to use Angular with a GraphQL server to render a list of "mytery boxes" that can be opened by the user. 

When opening a box, a Subscription from GraphQL is updated, thus updating the balance of the current wallets of the user on the header of the app.

No tests were developed for this app, so the only commands available are the usual for builiding/serving Angular applications:

`npm run serve`

`npm run build`

Prints from the app:
